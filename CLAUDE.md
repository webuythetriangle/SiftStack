# CLAUDE.md — SiftStack

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**SiftStack** — Full-stack real estate investing operations platform built around DataSift.ai CRM. Covers the entire REI business lifecycle:

1. **Data Acquisition:** Web scraping (NC-only via CLI — see below), scanned PDF import, courthouse terminal photo import (probate, eviction, code violations, divorce), Dropbox auto-polling
2. **Enrichment Pipeline:** 10+ steps — Smarty address standardization, Zillow property data, NC county tax delinquency APIs, obituary/heir research, Ancestry.com SSDI, Tracerfy skip trace, Trestle phone scoring, entity research
3. **Deal Analysis:** Comparable sales (Two-Bucket ARV), rehab estimation (4-tier room-by-room), deal analyzer (MAO/ROI/financing scenarios)
4. **Market Intelligence:** Zip code scoring, Market Finder reports, cash buyer list building, investor portfolio analysis
5. **CRM Automation:** DataSift upload, 26 TCA sequence templates, 12 niche sequential marketing presets, filter preset management, SiftMap sold property tagging
6. **Lead Management:** 4 Pillars of Motivation auto-qualification, STABM daily routine, pipeline reporting, deep prospecting (4-level framework)
7. **Operations:** Acquisition playbook generator (SOPs, scripts, checklists), Slack/Discord notifications, Google Drive upload, Apify Actor deployment

Active market is NC (Wake, Durham, Orange, Guilford, Mecklenburg counties) via the CLI (`nc-daily`/`nc-historical`, `ecourts-daily`/`ecourts-historical`) and GitHub Actions (`daily.yml`). **TN (Knox/Blount, tnpublicnotice.com) CLI scrape modes and Knox-specific enrichment (parcel/probate/tax lookups) were removed** (see "TN Scrape Removal" below) — TN survives only in the separate Apify Actor deployment (`actor_main()` in `src/main.py`), which was deliberately left untouched and still uses `scraper.py`/`tax_enricher.py`/`config.SAVED_SEARCHES` on its own.

8. **REI Skill Library:** 13 Claude Co-Work skill files (`.skill`/`.plugin` ZIPs) for distribution to DataSift community via [learn.datasift.ai/claude-skills-rei](https://learn.datasift.ai/claude-skills-rei). Skills teach Claude specific REI workflows when uploaded to Co-Work sessions or Projects.

## Architecture

**Data flows:**
- **Web scrape (TN, Apify Actor only — see "TN Scrape Removal" below):** `main.py actor_main()` → `scraper.py` → `captcha_solver.py` → `notice_parser.py` + `foreclosure_filter.py` → enrichment → Apify dataset
- **Web scrape (NC, CLI):** `main.py` → `ncnotices_scraper.py` / `ecourts_scraper.py` → `notice_parser.py` → enrichment → CSV
- **PDF import:** `main.py` → `pdf_importer.py` (pypdfium2 → `image_utils.py` OCR) → enrichment → CSV
- **Photo import:** `main.py` → `photo_importer.py` (OpenCV → `image_utils.py` OCR → `llm_parser.py`) → enrichment → CSV
- **Dropbox watch:** `dropbox_watcher.py` → `photo_importer.py` → enrichment → CSV (auto-polling loop)
- **Market Finder:** `extract_market_finder.py` → DataSift Market Finder (Playwright) → paginate all ZIP + neighborhood data → JSON → `generate_knox_report.py` → 7-sheet Excel

- **main.py** — CLI entry point. Parses args (`nc-daily`/`nc-historical`/`ecourts-daily`/`ecourts-historical`, `--split`, `--counties`, `--types`, `-v`). Filters saved searches by county/type, orchestrates scrape → dedup → export, logs run summary stats. Also contains `actor_main()`, a separate TN-only entry point used exclusively by the Apify Actor deployment — see "TN Scrape Removal" below.
- **scraper.py** — Playwright browser automation for TN (tnpublicnotice.com), used only by `actor_main()` now. Reuses saved session cookies when possible, falls back to fresh login. Selects each saved search from the Smart Search dropdown (triggers ASP.NET postback), paginates results (50/page max), clicks each View button to open notice detail pages. Uses `last_run.json` for daily mode state, `cookies.json` for session persistence.
- **captcha_solver.py** — Solves reCAPTCHA v2 via **2Captcha API** on every notice detail page. Sends websiteURL + sitekey, gets back a `g-recaptcha-response` token, injects it, clicks "View Notice". Retries up to 3 times. This is the primary bottleneck (~10-30s per notice).
- **notice_parser.py** — Extracts structured fields from raw notice text using regex. There are NO structured HTML fields on the site — address, owner, dates are all embedded in free-text notice bodies. Defines the `NoticeData` dataclass used throughout.
- **foreclosure_filter.py** — Filters foreclosure search results to only keep real first-to-market trustee sales. Matches against observed title variations (substitute/successor trustee sales). Non-foreclosure notice types pass through unfiltered.
- **data_formatter.py** — Deduplicates by address (keeps most recent), then converts `NoticeData` list to Sift upload CSV. Split mode produces `{county}_{type}_{timestamp}.csv` files.
- **config.py** — Credentials (from `.env`), ASP.NET element selectors, saved search definitions, rate limiting constants, paths, image processing thresholds.
- **image_utils.py** — Shared OCR utilities used by both `pdf_importer.py` and `photo_importer.py`. Exports `fix_rotation()` (Tesseract OSD) and `ocr_page(image, psm)` with configurable page segmentation mode. Handles Tesseract binary detection.
- **photo_importer.py** — Courthouse phone photo import. OpenCV preprocessing chain (EXIF transpose → blur check → bilateral filter → perspective correction → Otsu threshold) → Tesseract OCR (PSM 4) → LLM parsing → NoticeData. Supports all 7 notice types.
- **dropbox_watcher.py** — Cursor-based Dropbox folder polling. Downloads new photos, resolves county + notice_type from folder path (`/Knox/eviction/photo.jpg`), processes through photo_importer, deletes from Dropbox after success. State persisted to `dropbox_state.json` + `photo_state.json`.
- **report_generator.py** — Generates per-record PDF deep prospecting reports using reportlab. Includes property summary, signing chain with phone tiers, valuation, deceased owner detection. Output to `output/reports/`.
- **extract_market_finder.py** — Playwright automation to extract ALL ZIP code + neighborhood data from DataSift Market Finder. Handles styled-component dropdowns, pagination (20 rows/page), Beamer popup dismissal. Outputs JSON. See "Market Finder Extraction Patterns" below.
- **market_analyzer.py** — ZIP code scoring engine. 6-factor weighted composite (Distress 30%, Value 20%, Equity 15%, Tax Delinquency 15%, Competition 10%, DOM 10%). Grades A/B/C/D, budget allocation across top ZIPs. Reads from scraped notice CSVs in `output/`.
- **drive_uploader.py** — Google Drive upload via service account. `upload_file()` (generic, returns webViewLink) and `upload_csv()` (CSV-specific, returns file ID).

## TN Scrape Removal (2026-07-22)

TN (Knox/Blount, tnpublicnotice.com) was the original market this project was built around, but active work has moved to NC. This was a deliberate removal of *call sites*, not a deletion of the underlying implementation — nothing about `scraper.py`, `captcha_solver.py`, `foreclosure_filter.py`, or `tax_enricher.py` was changed; they simply aren't invoked from the CLI or the shared enrichment pipeline anymore.

**Removed:**
- CLI `daily`/`historical` modes — no longer valid `--mode` choices in `main.py`'s argparse. The ~180-line `_run_scrape_pipeline()` function that backed them (scrape → probate lookup → enrichment → Tracerfy → DataSift upload → Slack) was deleted along with the dispatch code that called it.
- `enrichment_pipeline.py` Step 3c (Knox-only probate property lookup via `tax_enricher._probate_property_lookup`) and Step 4 (Knox-only parcel address lookup via `tax_enricher.lookup_parcel_addresses`) — both were gated to `county.lower() == "knox"` and had no NC equivalent, so they're gone outright rather than left as dead Knox-only branches.
- The Knox County call inside Step 5 (`tax_enricher.enrich_tax_delinquency`) — Step 5 is NC-only now (`nc_tax_enricher.enrich_nc_tax_delinquency`, see "NC Tax Delinquency Enrichment").
- The commented-out `daily.yml` GitHub Actions step (it referenced the now-removed `python src/main.py daily` CLI invocation, so kept it accurate rather than leaving stale dead config).

**Deliberately NOT touched — `actor_main()` (Apify Actor mode):** This is a separate, TN-only entry point (`TNPN_EMAIL`/`TNPN_PASSWORD` credentials, `scraper.scrape_all()`, `config.SAVED_SEARCHES`) used exclusively by the Apify cloud deployment, not by the CLI or `daily.yml`. It was left running as-is since disabling it wouldn't stop a live Apify Console schedule anyway — it would just make scheduled runs start failing with no NC replacement to fall back to. **Known consequence:** because `actor_main()` calls the same shared `run_enrichment_pipeline()`, any future TN scrape through it will no longer get Knox parcel-address-fixing or Knox tax-delinquency enrichment (Steps 3c/4/Knox-5 are gone from the shared pipeline) — scraping, other enrichment steps, and DataSift upload still work, just without those two Knox-specific enrichments. If TN/Apify is ever revived in earnest, that gap needs a conscious decision (re-add a Knox-gated branch, or accept the loss).

**Untouched by design:** `config.SAVED_SEARCHES` (Knox/Blount saved searches — still read by `actor_main()`), `main.py`'s `_filter_searches()` (same reason), `tax_enricher.py` itself (now dead code from the CLI's perspective but still imported by nothing — kept in the repo, not deleted), and the `manage-sold` SiftMap workflow's Knox/Blount default (a separate CRM tagging feature, not the scrape/enrichment pipeline).

## Site-Specific Details

The site is **ASP.NET WebForms** — all navigation uses `__doPostBack()` with ViewState. Session IDs are embedded in URL paths (`/(S({guid}))/`). Playwright is required because direct HTTP requests would need to manage ViewState/EventValidation manually.

**reCAPTCHA v2 is required on every single notice detail page**, even when logged in. There is no CAPTCHA on login, search, or results pages. The sitekey is hardcoded in `config.py`.

## Saved Searches

8 searches defined in `config.py` as `SAVED_SEARCHES`. Each maps to an exact dropdown option name on the Smart Search dashboard:
- Knox & Blount × (Foreclosure V2, Tax Sale V2, Tax Delinquent V2, Probate V2)

Filterable via `--counties` and `--types` CLI args (comma-separated, or omit for all).

## Key Domain Rules

- **Foreclosure filtering is critical.** Not all notices from "Foreclosure" saved searches are actual foreclosures. The scraper parses each notice's full text and only includes ones with trustee sale language. See `INCLUDE_PHRASES` / `EXCLUDE_PHRASES` in `foreclosure_filter.py`.
- **Probate owner_name** should be the Personal Representative/Executor/Administrator — not the deceased.
- **Owner names** in foreclosure notices typically appear after "executed by" in the deed of trust language.
- **Rate limiting:** 2-3 second random delays between requests, 3 retries per page.
- **Address dedup:** Same property can appear in multiple notices (including a re-published/amended notice with a new ID for a property already scraped). `data_formatter.deduplicate()` merges same-property notices field-by-field (newer non-empty fields win, older fields fall back) instead of discarding one wholesale. `property_registry.py` extends this across runs — a persisted `seen_properties.json` (keyed by address+zip+notice_type+county) lets a notice re-published on a later day update the existing lead instead of creating a duplicate. See "Property Registry" below.

## Output

CSV files land in `output/` (gitignored). Logs go to `logs/` with timestamped filenames. Sift columns: `date_added, address, city, state, zip, owner_name, notice_type, county, source_url`.

## Property Registry (Cross-Run Lead Dedup)

`src/property_registry.py` prevents a re-published/amended notice (postponed foreclosure sale, amended probate filing, etc. — same event, new notice ID) from showing up as a second lead for a property already scraped, whether that happened earlier in the same run or on a prior day.

- **State file:** `seen_properties.json` (repo root, gitignored, persisted across scheduled runs via the same GitHub Actions cache as `seen_ids.json`). Pruned after `SEEN_PROPERTIES_PRUNE_DAYS` (180) days.
- **Key:** `address + zip + notice_type + county` (normalized, uppercased). Deliberately includes `notice_type` — a probate followed later by a foreclosure on the same address is a distinct event and is NOT merged; only a re-notice of the *same* type merges.
- **Merge rule (`merge_notice_data`):** field-by-field, the newer notice's non-empty value wins; if it's blank, the previously-known value (e.g. last run's Zillow/NARRPR/decision-maker enrichment) is kept instead of being lost.
- **Wired into `enrichment_pipeline.run_enrichment_pipeline()`** as Step 9a, after all enrichment steps run (so the merge sees each notice's freshly-fetched data) and before final validation — every entry point (`daily`, `nc-daily`, `historical`, PDF import, photo import, CSV import) gets this automatically since they all funnel through the shared pipeline.
- `data_formatter.deduplicate()` (pipeline Step 2, same-run only) does the equivalent merge for notices that collide within a single run, since two differently-ID'd notices for the same property can both appear inside one scrape's lookback window.

## NC eCourts Portal (Special Proceedings Foreclosures)

Third NC scrape source, alongside `ncnotices_scraper.py` (published sale notices). A power-of-sale foreclosure in NC is filed as a **Special Proceeding** (NCGS Chapter 45, Article 2A) — the trustee/substitute trustee files a "Notice of Hearing" with the Clerk of Superior Court *before* any sale notice is published in the newspaper. `src/ecourts_scraper.py` targets this SP filing directly at the statewide **NC eCourts Portal** (`portal-nc.tylertech.cloud`, Tyler Technologies Odyssey — all 100 counties as of the Oct 13, 2025 rollout), so this is materially first-to-market versus waiting for `ncnotices_scraper.py`'s newspaper publication weeks later.

- **Target counties:** same 5 as `NC_SAVED_SEARCHES` — Wake, Durham, Orange, Guilford, Mecklenburg (`config.ECOURTS_TARGET_COUNTIES`).
- **CLI:** `python src/main.py ecourts-daily` / `ecourts-historical`, same `--counties`/`--split`/`--since`/`--max-notices` flags as the other scrape modes.
- **Key files:** `ecourts_scraper.py` (Scrapfly-driven fetch + search + result parsing), `ecourts_notice_parser.py` (case-type filtering + case metadata; reuses `nc_notice_parser._parse_address_nc` for property address since that logic is state-specific, not source-specific).
- **Case-type filtering:** Special Proceedings covers far more than foreclosures (adoptions, guardianships, partitions, name changes, judicial sales, involuntary commitments). Only cases whose caption matches `foreclosure...of a...deed of trust/mortgage` are kept — see `ecourts_notice_parser.is_foreclosure_special_proceeding`.
- **Dedup:** merges into the same `property_registry` key (`address+zip+notice_type+county`) as `ncnotices.com` foreclosures — an eCourts hit today and that property's later-published sale notice collapse into one lead instead of two.

### Why Scrapfly instead of 2Captcha here (hard-won, 2026-07-19)

`portal-nc.tylertech.cloud` is protected by **AWS WAF Bot Control** with a CAPTCHA "Human Verification" interstitial — not Google reCAPTCHA (`tnpublicnotice.com`) or Cloudflare Turnstile (`ncnotices.com`). Every unauthenticated Playwright navigation attempt was blocked immediately during initial testing. 2Captcha has no turnkey AWS WAF solving path the way it does for reCAPTCHA v2/Turnstile, so this source is built entirely on **Scrapfly's ASP (anti-scraping-protection) bypass** — no local Playwright browser at all; every page load is a `Scrapfly.async_scrape` call.

**Known limitation — confirm before relying on this in production.** Scrapfly's ASP did **not** clear this specific WAF on any of 4 live attempts during initial testing (`ERR::ASP::SHIELD_PROTECTION_FAILED`, with and without `render_js`). This may just need Scrapfly-side tuning (dedicated proxy pool, a support ticket about this specific target) rather than being a dead end, but it has not yet been confirmed working end-to-end. `ecourts_scraper.py._scrapfly_fetch()` retries shield failures automatically, and `python src/ecourts_scraper.py --inspect --county Wake` dumps the raw fetched HTML to `output/` for manual selector calibration once/if the bypass starts succeeding. The Smart Search form-fill selectors in `_build_search_scenario()` are label-text-based (same resilience pattern as `ncnotices_scraper.py._select_county`) since the live DOM couldn't be inspected directly — calibrate them against a real `--inspect` dump before trusting this for daily runs. If Scrapfly's success rate stays low, 2Captcha's "Amazon WAF" task type is worth evaluating as an alternative.

## NC Tax Delinquency Enrichment

Extends enrichment pipeline Step 5 (tax delinquency) to the 5 NC target counties (`config.ECOURTS_TARGET_COUNTIES` — Wake, Durham, Orange, Guilford, Mecklenburg), which were previously Knox-only (`tax_enricher.py` is a Knox-County-TN-specific `mygovonline.com` client with no NC coverage). `src/nc_tax_enricher.py` runs alongside it in the same pipeline step, independently — a failure in one doesn't block the other.

Unlike Knox's single REST API that covers address lookup, parcel lookup, and delinquency in one place, **each NC county publishes delinquent tax data through a completely different system** — there is one lookup path per county, not a shared client. All 4 automated sources below were confirmed live (2026-07-22) by actually downloading/querying them, not just reading vendor docs — one candidate source (see Guilford) turned out to be a different city's data entirely despite an identical schema, which is why every URL here was verified against real county addresses before being hardcoded.

- **Wake:** Daily bulk XLSX at `services.wake.gov/collection_extracts/REAL_ESTATE_delq853_MMDDYYYY.xlsx` (date-stamped filename, `_wake_download()` walks back up to 5 days if today's hasn't posted). Has separate `Street_Number`/`STREET_NAME` columns, so no address-string parsing is needed — direct match. Grouped by `ACCOUNT_NUM` across multiple `TAX_YEAR` rows for a total amount + delinquent-year count. No auth; `services.wake.gov/robots.txt` blanket-disallows all bots (advisory only, doesn't block a scripted download, but keep the request rate polite).
- **Durham:** An undocumented JSON endpoint on the county's Spatialest "Bill PWA" (`property.spatialest.com/nc/durham-tax/data/getData.php`, `POST qtype=delinquint_list` — note the vendor's own typo), found by reading the SPA's `main.js` for its AJAX calls since there's no published API docs. Returns the entire delinquent list (~3000 bills) in one stateless call, no session/cookies needed. **HTTPS is required — the HTTP version of the identical URL returns an empty 200 response**, which looks like a working-but-empty call unless you check both. Property address comes from the `AssetDescription` field (a single string, e.g. `"507 BERNICE ST DURHAM NC 27703"`), parsed with a regex. Tax year is derived from the `Bill` field's encoding (`0000118976-2025-2025-0000-00` → year `2025`) rather than a dedicated field.
- **Guilford:** Delinquency lives in one ArcGIS FeatureServer (`services5.arcgis.com/RR1v7NWFfwk98pUn/.../Tax_Delinquent_Report_/FeatureServer/0`) keyed by `PARCEL_NUM` (=REID) with **no address field at all** — property address comes from a second ArcGIS FeatureServer, the county's own parcel/cadastral layer (`gcgis.guilfordcountync.gov/.../GC_Parcels/FeatureServer/0`), joined on REID. A wrong first draft of this source — a same-schema ArcGIS layer at a different org ID, found via a generic web search — turned out to be **Virginia Beach, VA's delinquent tax data**, not Guilford's (same vendor template, same field names, completely different city). Only found the real endpoint via the GIS Hub's DCAT feed (`open-data-hub-guilfordgis.hub.arcgis.com/api/feed/dcat-us/1.1.json`). Address→REID resolves to more than one REID for some addresses (adjoining/resubdivided parcels sharing a street address) — the lookup checks all candidates against the delinquent index rather than assuming the first result is right.
- **Orange:** Annual bulk XLSX (published once, ~March, at `orangecountync.gov/DocumentCenter/View/27374`, cached 30 days) with owner name + legal description + parcel PIN + tax amount — **no property address column**. Joined by PIN against the county's ArcGIS parcel layer (`gis.orangecountync.gov/.../WebParcelService/MapServer/0`) for the actual situs address. Same multi-candidate-PIN issue as Guilford (confirmed live: `"2823 Butler Rd"` resolves to two different PINs, only one of which is delinquent) — same fix applies.
- **Mecklenburg — no automated source found.** `tax.mecknc.gov` and `taxbill.co.mecklenburg.nc.us` both actively block automated fetches (robots.txt `Content-Signal: ai-train=no`, and the bill-search portal 403s outside a real browser/WAF-challenge session). The GIS parcel layers (Polaris3G) carry ownership/valuation but no delinquency status. NC law (GS 105-369) requires the county to compile a full "Delinquent Taxpayer List" annually, but the only confirmed access path is requesting it directly from the Office of Tax Administration (704-336-7600) as a public records request — not a scrapeable file. `nc_tax_enricher.py` logs a one-time skip note for Mecklenburg notices rather than silently doing nothing.

**State:** Downloaded bulk files (Wake, Orange) cache to `nc_tax_cache/` (gitignored) — Wake re-checks daily, Orange reuses for 30 days. Durham and Guilford query live on every run (no local cache) since both are fast, complete-list API calls.

**Address matching:** All 4 sources match on a loose `(house_number, first_street_word)` key (`nc_tax_enricher._address_key()`) rather than an exact string match, since notice addresses are scraped/OCR'd free text while county files carry the official situs address.

## Apify Deployment

The project runs as an **Apify Actor** in the cloud. When `APIFY_IS_AT_HOME` or `APIFY_TOKEN` is set, `main.py` uses the Actor SDK instead of CLI args.

```bash
# Install Apify CLI
npm install -g apify-cli

# Local test (reads input.json, simulates Actor environment)
apify run --purge

# Deploy to Apify platform
apify login
apify push

# On Apify Console: set up daily schedule and configure secrets in Actor input
```

### Actor Input (configured in Apify Console or `input.json`)
- `mode`: "daily" or "historical"
- `counties` / `types`: arrays to filter saved searches (empty = all)
- `tn_username`, `tn_password`, `captcha_api_key`: secrets (required)
- `google_drive_folder_id`, `google_service_account_key`: optional Google Drive upload

### Actor Output
- **Dataset**: structured records pushed via `Actor.push_data()`
- **Key-value store**: `output.csv` backup
- **Google Drive** (optional): CSV + summary text file uploaded via service account

### Key Files
- `.actor/actor.json` — Actor manifest (name, version, Dockerfile path)
- `.actor/input_schema.json` — Input fields + validation for Apify Console UI
- `Dockerfile` — Based on `apify/actor-python-playwright:3.12`
- `src/drive_uploader.py` — Google Drive upload via base64-encoded service account key
- `input.json` — Local test input (gitignored, contains credentials)

## Courthouse Photo Pipeline (build 1.0.28+)

Courthouse terminal photos → OCR → LLM parse → enrichment → DataSift. Runner takes phone photos at Knox/Blount county terminals, uploads to Dropbox organized as `{county}/{notice_type}/`, system auto-processes.

### Notice Types (7 total)
- `foreclosure`, `tax_sale`, `tax_delinquent`, `probate` — existing from web scraper
- `eviction` — plaintiff = landlord (target contact), defendant = tenant
- `code_violation` — owner of record, violation type, compliance deadline
- `divorce` — petitioner + respondent, property from schedule page

### Critical OCR Patterns (hard-won from live testing)

**Moire pattern from terminal screens is the #1 OCR killer.** Standard Tesseract preprocessing (adaptive threshold, CLAHE) produces garbage on courthouse terminal photos. The fix:
- **Bilateral filter** (`cv2.bilateralFilter(gray, 15, 75, 75)`) removes moire while preserving text edges
- **Otsu threshold** (`cv2.THRESH_BINARY + cv2.THRESH_OTSU`) after bilateral — auto-determines optimal binary threshold
- **PSM 4** (single column variable text) for terminal screens — NOT PSM 6 (single uniform block) which was the research recommendation but fails in practice
- **Do NOT use `fix_rotation()` (Tesseract OSD) on phone photos** — EXIF transpose handles rotation. OSD on raw phone images often fails and the 270° fallback rotates correct images sideways

### Probate Deep Prospecting (from courthouse terminals)

Courthouse probate records have decedent name + PR/executor name but NO property address. Multi-tier lookup fills the gap:

**Property Address Lookup** (Step 3c in enrichment pipeline):
1. **Tier 1: Knox Tax API name search** — search `/parcels/{decedent_name}`, score by token overlap (FIRST MIDDLE LAST → LAST FIRST MIDDLE), accept >= 0.4 match. Tries multiple name variations (with/without suffix, LAST FIRST format, first+last only).
2. **Tier 2: Executor family search** — search Knox Tax API by executor name, look for properties where decedent's last name appears in owner field (family property transferred to executor).
3. **Tier 3: People search** — search TruePeopleSearch/FastPeopleSearch for decedent's last known Knox County address.

**Probate Preset** (obituary enricher):
- Triggers when court record has PR name + decedent name (no address required) — prevents wrong obituary from overriding court-named executor
- Sets DM = the named PR/executor directly, skips obituary search entirely
- Then runs DM address lookup (Knox Tax API → People Search → Tracerfy)

**DOD Sanity Check** (obituary enricher):
- Rejects obituary matches where DOD is > 3 years before the notice filing date (`MAX_DOD_GAP_YEARS = 3`)
- Prevents matching a 2014 obituary to a 2025 court filing (wrong person with same name)
- Applied to both full-page and snippet matches

## DataSift.ai (REISift) Integration

DataSift.ai (formerly REISift) is the CRM where scraped records land for niche sequential marketing campaigns. There is **no REST API** — upload is via Playwright browser automation of the web UI.

**Domain:** `app.reisift.io` (NOT `app.datasift.ai`). API at `apiv2.reisift.io`.

### Key Files
- `src/datasift_formatter.py` — Transforms `NoticeData` → DataSift CSV (41 columns)
- `src/datasift_uploader.py` — Playwright login + upload wizard + enrich + skip trace + preset management + sequence builder + SiftMap sold workflow
- `test_datasift_upload.py` — Headed browser test (upload + enrich + skip trace)
- `test_manage_presets.py` — Headed browser test (preset discovery + sold exclusion + sequence creation)
- `test_manage_sold.py` — Headed browser test (SiftMap sold property tagging)

### CSV Column Structure (41 columns)
- **Core auto-mapped (11):** Property Street/City/State/ZIP, Owner First/Last Name, Mailing Street/City/State/ZIP, Tags
- **Lists + Notes (2):** Lists (for niche sequential), Notes (contextual per notice type)
- **Built-in fields (13):** Estimated Value, MSL Status, Last Sale Date/Price, Equity Percentage, Tax Deliquent Value, Tax Delinquent Year, Tax Auction Date, Foreclosure Date, Probate Open Date, Personal Representative, Parcel ID, Structure Type, Year Built, Living SqFt, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Lot (Acres)
- **Custom fields (15):** Notice Type, County, Date Added, Owner Deceased, Date of Death, Decedent Name, Decision Maker, DM Relationship, DM Confidence, DM 2/3 Name/Relationship, Obituary URL, Source URL
- **NARRPR RVM fields (5, added alongside Source URL):** RVM Value, RVM Value Low, RVM Value High, RVM Confidence, RVM Updated Date — second AVM cross-check against the built-in Estimated Value (Zestimate). Also present in the plain `data_formatter.write_csv()` output (non-DataSift CSV).

### Niche Sequential Marketing
DataSift's niche sequential system uses filter presets to guide records through SMS → Call → Mail → Deep Prospecting phases. Two preset folders: "00 Niche Sequential Marketing" (12 presets, courthouse data) and "01. Bulk Sequential Marketing" (9 presets, bulk data). All 21 presets exclude Sold status (build 1.0.23). A "Sold Property Cleanup" sequence in the Transactions folder auto-fires on "Sold" tag to change status, remove from lists, clear tasks, and clear assignee.

- **"Courthouse Data" tag:** Every record gets this tag — signals first-to-market county data (prioritized over bulk data in filter presets)
- **Lists column:** Maps `notice_type` → DataSift list name (`foreclosure` → "Foreclosure", `probate` → "Probate", `tax_sale` → "Tax Sale", `tax_delinquent` → "Tax Delinquent", `eviction` → "Eviction", `code_violation` → "Code Violation", `divorce` → "Divorce"). DataSift auto-creates lists from CSV.
- **Tags:** Courthouse Data, notice_type, county, YYYY-MM date, deceased/living, DM confidence level, has_auction, tax_delinquent, photo_import (for photo-sourced records)

### Upload Wizard (5 Steps)
1. **Setup:** Click "Upload File" sidebar → "Add Data" → dropdown "Uploading a new list not in DataSift yet" → enter list name → organization questions
2. **Tags:** Skip through (tags are in CSV column)
3. **Upload File:** Set file on `input[type="file"]`
4. **Map Columns:** Core address fields auto-map; Tags, Lists, and enrichment columns may need manual mapping
5. **Review + Finish Upload:** Click "Finish Upload" — processing happens in background

### Column Mapping Notes
- Only core address fields (Property Street, City, State, ZIP) reliably auto-map
- Tags, Lists, Estimated Value, and enrichment columns often stay unmapped in step 4
- Notes and MSL Status sometimes auto-map
- Custom fields (TN Public Notice group) require drag-and-drop mapping

### Contact Logic
- **Deceased owners:** Contact = decision maker (first/last name + mailing address from DM)
- **Living owners:** Contact = property owner (owner mailing address, falls back to property address)

### Post-Upload: Enrich + Skip Trace

After CSV upload, the pipeline automatically runs two DataSift actions via Playwright:

1. **Enrich Property Information** (Manage → Enrich Data): Adds SiftMap property data (beds, baths, Zestimate, sqft, sale history) to uploaded records. "Enrich Owners" and "Swap Owners" are OFF — protects our PR/DM contact mapping.
2. **Skip Trace** (Send To → Skip Trace): Pulls phone numbers (up to 5 per owner) + emails via unlimited plan ($97/mo). Adds auto-tag `skip_traced_YYYY-MM`.

Both run in background — tracked in Activity tab. Both are ON by default when `--upload-datasift` is set.

### CLI Flags
```bash
python src/main.py daily --upload-datasift        # upload + enrich + skip trace
python src/main.py daily --upload-datasift --no-enrich       # upload only, skip enrichment
python src/main.py daily --upload-datasift --no-skip-trace   # upload + enrich, skip skip trace
python src/main.py daily --notify-slack            # send run summary to Slack/Discord
```

### Environment Variables
- `DATASIFT_EMAIL` — DataSift login email
- `DATASIFT_PASSWORD` — DataSift login password
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` — Slack/Discord webhook for run summaries

### Login Selectors (SPA quirks)
- Hidden checkboxes (Remember me, Terms) — click `<label>` elements, not `<input>`
- Use `wait_until="domcontentloaded"` (not `networkidle` — SPA keeps WebSocket connections open)
- Cookie validation: check for `/dashboard` or `/records` in URL (5s wait for SPA redirect)

### DataSift UI Automation Patterns

Hard-won patterns from build 1.0.22-1.0.23 (SiftMap, preset management, sequence builder). Follow these to avoid repeating past mistakes.

**Styled-Components (no native HTML controls)**
- No native `<select>` elements — all dropdowns are `[class*="Selectstyles__Select"]` containers
- `[class*="SelectValue"]` = current value display; `[class*="SelectOptionContainer"]` = dropdown options
- Multiple Select dropdowns exist per panel (Lists, Tags, Property Status) — always target the **LAST visible one**
- Use `x > 450` bounds check in all JS queries to avoid matching sidebar elements (sidebar is 0-400px)
- React state updates require native setter + event dispatch, not just `.value = ...`:
  ```js
  const setter = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(window.HTMLInputElement.prototype, 'value').set;
  setter.call(input, 'new value');
  input.dispatchEvent(new Event('input', {bubbles: true}));
  input.dispatchEvent(new Event('change', {bubbles: true}));
  ```

**Panel Scrolling (Playwright scroll fails)**
- Filter panel is a scrollable `<div>`, NOT the viewport — `scroll_into_view_if_needed()` does nothing
- Use JS: `el.scrollIntoView({behavior: 'instant', block: 'center'})` instead
- Filter Presets section is at the BOTTOM of the filter panel — must scroll container down to reveal
- After scrollIntoView, element y-positions may be negative — don't filter by `y > 0` for the target element

**React DnD (Sequence Builder)**
- Cards have `draggable="false"` — Playwright's native drag won't work
- Must use slow mouse drag: `mouse.move()` → `mouse.down()` → 20 incremental steps (50ms each) → `mouse.up()`
- Add 500ms pauses between down/move/up phases
- "Add new Action +" button required for 2nd+ actions; first action uses initial drop zone
- Sidebar cards can scroll out of view when main area scrolls — scroll BOTH source and target into view before drag

**Pointer Interception (common blockers)**
- Beamer NPS survey iframe (`#npsIframeContainer`) blocks ALL pointer events globally — remove from DOM via `_dismiss_popups()`
- `RecordsFiltersstyles__RecordsFiltersSection` elements intercept clicks — use `page.evaluate()` JS click or `force=True`
- When Playwright click fails with "outside of viewport" or "intercept": switch to `page.evaluate(el => el.click())`
- SiftMap PropertyDetails panel blocks sidebar checkboxes — remove from DOM before interactions

**Preset Management Workflow**
- Flow: open filter panel → scroll to bottom → expand "Filter Presets" → expand folder → click preset → modify → Save (not Save New) → confirm overwrite
- Folder names have case variations ("00 Niche" vs "00 NICHE") — use `.toUpperCase()` comparison
- Preset names follow pattern `^\d{2}\.` (e.g., "00. Needs Skipped")
- 2 folders: "00 Niche Sequential Marketing" (12 presets), "01. Bulk Sequential Marketing" (9 presets)
- All 21 presets have Property Status "Do not include" → "Sold" (build 1.0.23)

**Sequence Builder Workflow**
- Flow: `/sequences` → Create → title + folder → drag trigger → condition → actions tab → drag actions → configure → save
- Duplicate name handling: detect error toast "different sequence title", retry with " V2" suffix
- Actions tab: navigate via "Set the Following Actions" button or URL (`/sequences/new/actions`)
- Autocomplete inputs: after each selection, `fill("")` + Escape to dismiss dropdown before next entry
- "Sold Property Cleanup" sequence exists in Transactions folder (build 1.0.23): Trigger (Property Tags Added) → Condition (Sold) → Actions (Status→Sold, Remove Lists, Clear Tasks, Clear Assignee)

**SiftMap Automation**
- Search by city (NOT county): Knox → "Knoxville, TN", Blount → "Maryville, TN"
- PropertyDetails panel auto-opens on search — remove from DOM before other interactions
- "Add Records to Account" modal: toggle OFF "Do not replace owners", add tags, dismiss dropdown by clicking heading (NOT Escape — clears tags)
- Known limitation: SiftMap filters (price, date) set values visually but don't trigger React re-query. Only sidebar-visible properties (~3-5) get added per run

**Market Finder Extraction Patterns (build 1.0.29+)**

Hard-won patterns from building `extract_market_finder.py`. The Market Finder UI differs significantly from the rest of DataSift.

- **NO HTML `<table>` element** — data table is entirely div-based: `Tablestyles__TableContainer` → `TableRow` → `TableCell` (styled-components). Searching for `<table>` or `<tr>/<td>` finds nothing.
- **PAGINATION, not infinite scroll** — table shows 20 rows per page with "1-20 of N" text and `PaginationInnerContainer` with prev/next `<button>` elements. Must click through ALL pages to get complete data. Knox County has 48 ZIPs (3 pages) and 120+ neighborhoods (7 pages).
- **State/County selection uses `InputMultiSearch`** — NOT styled-component Select dropdowns. Inputs have placeholders: `"Select States"`, `"Select Counties"`, `"Select ZIP Codes"`. Click input → type name → click dropdown result item (`[class*="Item"]:has-text("...")`).
- **ZIP/Neighborhood toggle is a styled Select dropdown** — at the top bar with `Selectstyles__SelectValue` showing current view. Check the displayed text BEFORE clicking — if already on the correct view, clicking toggles AWAY from it. Only click to switch if the displayed text doesn't match the desired view.
- **Beamer push modal (`#beamerPushModal`)** — appears on fresh login, blocks ALL pointer events. Different from the NPS survey (`#npsIframeContainer`). Both must be removed from DOM before any click interactions. Always call dismiss with `force=True` as fallback.
- **Page body scrolling required** — pagination controls are at `y=1867`, below the viewport (`clientH=824`). Must scroll `AdminPage__AdminPageBody` container down before pagination buttons are accessible.
- **Summary panel on right side** — shows county-level aggregates: Median Home Value, Homes on Market, Mo. Investor Transactions, Homes Sold Last Month, Market Rent, Gross Rental Yield, Homeownership Rate. Extract via regex on page text.

```bash
# Extract all Market Finder data for a county
python src/extract_market_finder.py --state "Tennessee" --county "Knox" -v
python src/extract_market_finder.py --state "Tennessee" --county "Knox,Blount" --headless

# Output: JSON file in output/market_finder_{state}_{county}_{timestamp}.json
```

## NARRPR (RPR) RVM Enrichment (opt-in, build 1.0.30+)

Enrichment step that pulls **RVM (RPR Valuation Model)** data from the user's NARRPR (narrpr.com / Realtors Property Resource) account — a second AVM to cross-check against the Zillow Zestimate already captured in `estimated_value`. On by default whenever `NARRPR_EMAIL` / `NARRPR_PASSWORD` are set in `.env` (`skip_narrpr: bool = False` on `PipelineOptions`); disable per-run with `--no-narrpr` on any CLI entry point (including the NC `nc-daily`/`nc-historical` modes). No-ops with a log line if credentials aren't configured.

### Key Files
- `src/narrpr_enricher.py` — `NarrprSession` (Playwright login + direct API calls) and `enrich_rvm_data(notices)` (sync entry point called by `enrichment_pipeline.py`)

### Critical Design Constraint: Single-Session Accounts

**RPR enforces exactly one concurrent session per account.** Logging in anywhere — including the user's own browser — immediately signs out every other active session, and a popup ("Another user detected... has been signed out") confirms it happened. This was confirmed live: an automated login bumped the user's own manual session.

Consequences for this module:
- **No disk-persisted cookie reuse across separate runs.** Unlike `datasift_core.py`'s `cookies.json` pattern, saving NARRPR session cookies to disk provides no benefit — any subsequent login (by the user manually, or by a later script run) invalidates the earlier session anyway. `narrpr_enricher.py` deliberately does NOT persist cookies; it authenticates once per run and holds that one browser session for the entire batch.
- **Running enrichment while the user is actively using narrpr.com will sign them out**, and vice versa. Since this now runs by default on every pipeline run, schedule automated runs (including the daily Apify cron) for times the user isn't in RPR, or pass `--no-narrpr` on runs where that matters.
- **The bearer token expires after ~1 hour** (JWT `exp` = `iat` + 3600s). `enrich_rvm_data()` does not attempt token refresh — batches that could run longer should be chunked externally.

### No Public API — Direct JSON Endpoints (not page scraping)

Unlike DataSift's UI-automation pattern, RPR's Angular SPA turned out to have clean, well-structured JSON endpoints under `webapi.narrpr.com` that can be called directly via Playwright's `context.request` after a single login — **no per-property page navigation needed**. This was discovered by sniffing XHR/fetch traffic (`page.on("response")`) while manually driving the UI, not from any documentation.

**Auth mechanism:** After login, an OIDC access token JWT is readable from the non-httpOnly `oidc.at` cookie on `www.narrpr.com` (1-hour expiry). Extract it once and send as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on every subsequent API call — the Angular app does this itself via JS, but raw HTTP calls must set the header manually since Playwright's request context doesn't execute page JS.

**Three-call chain to go from a free-text address to RVM data:**
1. `GET webapi.narrpr.com/misc/location-suggestions?userQuery={address}&userLatitude=...&userLongitude=...&category=1&getPlacesAreasAndProperties=true&getStreets=false&getListingIdsApnsAndTaxIds=false&getSchools=false` → returns `sections[0].locations[0].propertyId` (or an empty list if no match — vacant land and off-market parcels can still resolve here, but see step 3).
2. `GET webapi.narrpr.com/properties/{propertyId}/common?preferredPropertyMode=1` → returns `orgId`, `listingId`, `zipPlaceId`, `propertyMode` needed for step 3, plus a raw `estimatedValue` int (the RVM point estimate, when one exists).
3. `GET webapi.narrpr.com/properties/{propertyId}/details?orgId=&listingId=&zipPlaceId=&propertyMode=&sections=43` → `summarySection.hasEstimatedValue` (bool — **false for vacant land and commercial/special-purpose buildings**, RVM only applies to residential), `estimatedRangeFrom`/`estimatedRangeTo` (exact ints, not the rounded "$630.8K" shown in the UI), `estimatedValueConfidenceScore` (0-100, shown as 1-5 stars in the UI), `estimatedValueDate`, `last1MonthChangeAmount`, `last12MonthChangePercent`.

`userLatitude`/`userLongitude` on the geocode call bias ambiguous matches toward a market — hardcoded to Knoxville, TN centroid (`35.9606, -83.9207`) since this project's addresses are all Knox/Blount County.

### Verified Behavior
- Active residential listing (single-family, has MLS listing): full RVM data returned (`hasEstimatedValue: true`).
- Vacant land parcel: geocode resolves to a real `propertyId`, but `hasEstimatedValue: false` — no RVM range/confidence populated. `enrich_rvm_data()` leaves `rvm_*` fields blank rather than guessing.
- Commercial/special-purpose building (e.g., an office/bank building): same — resolves to a real property, no RVM.
- A street name with no house number can still resolve to exactly one `propertyId` if RPR's index only has one addressable parcel matching that broad query — don't assume a bare street name always returns a "several matches" list.

### `NoticeData` Fields (added to `notice_parser.py`)
`rvm_value`, `rvm_value_low`, `rvm_value_high`, `rvm_confidence` (0-100), `rvm_updated_date` — placed alongside the existing Zillow fields (`estimated_value`, etc.) for side-by-side AVM comparison.
